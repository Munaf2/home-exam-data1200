                Universal design is based on creating products that ensure

            The current usage of smartphones in everyday life
        </h2>
        <p>
            Smartphones are widely used in the world and almost
            everyone has one. Most people rely on their smartphones to
            communicate with others and really depend on them to get
            through everyday life. The smartphone is used to pay bills,
            access personal files and some people even rely on it to do
            their jobs. Other usage of smartphones in everyday life is
            social media, news, navigation, and entertainment such as
            games and movies.

        <h2>
            Three ways this technology fails to comply with key principles in universal design
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first problem with this technology is that it has a
            complicated and advanced design, especially for elder people.
            It could be difficult to navigate through the phone and even
            harder to adjust and personal customizations that would make
            it easier to use the smartphone. Also, there are a lot of
            functions and buttons that change settings, modes etc. and it is ten
            hard to keep track of them and even harder noticing if you
            accidentally pressed one.

            Three ways this technology complies with key principles in universal design
        </h2>
        <p>
            Smartphones have many great built-in features that make it
            easier for people to use them such as screen readers, size
            adjustments and voice commands. This makes the technology
            more user friendly and more adaptable for everyone to use.

    <div class="impact">
        <h2>
            What is the potential impact of a strict enforcement of universal
            design on all digital products?
        </h2>
        <p>
            First of all, more people will be able to use the products and
            they will be more user-friendly. This will make digital products
            more accessible and included to all people in society. If the
            product does not comply with the law, there will be economic
            consequences through fines. This could hurt small businesses
            who cannot afford to make a mistake in production and in the
            worst case could lead to bankruptcy.

# bruke picture element??

Hva mener han med at den skal være annerledes, er det noe jeg burde vise frem her?

Hvis jeg tar en kode fra w3school er det mulig å kunne se det?
I så fall skal jeg bare forklare koden
