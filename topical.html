                    The current usage of smartphones in everyday life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smartphones are widely used in the world and almost
                    everyone has one. Most people rely on their smartphones to
                    communicate with others and really depend on them to get
                    through everyday life. The smartphone is used to pay bills,
                    access personal files and some people even rely on it to do
                    their jobs. Other usage of smartphones in everyday life is
                    social media, news, navigation, and entertainment such as
                    games and movies.

                    Three ways this technology fails to comply with key principles in universal design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first problem with this technology is that it has a
                    complicated and advanced design, especially for elder people.
                    It could be difficult to navigate through the phone and even
                    harder to adjust and personal customizations that would make
                    it easier to use the smartphone. Also, there are a lot of
                    functions and buttons that change settings, modes etc. and it is ten
                    hard to keep track of them and even harder noticing if you
                    accidentally pressed one.

                <p>
                    Smartphones have many great built-in features that make it
                    easier for people to use them such as screen readers, size
                    adjustments and voice commands. This makes the technology
                    more user friendly and more adaptable for everyone to use.

                    What is the potential impact of a strict enforcement of universal
                    design on all digital products?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, more people will be able to use the products and
                    they will be more user-friendly. This will make digital products
                    more accessible and included to all people in society. If the
                    product does not comply with the law, there will be economic
                    consequences through fines. This could hurt small businesses
                    who cannot afford to make a mistake in production and in the
                    worst case could lead to bankruptcy.
